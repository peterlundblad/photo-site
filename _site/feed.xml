For two Californians, accustomed to sunshine and mild winters, it was a delightful surprise. A proper snow day, right here in the medieval town of Semur-en-Auxois, France!</p>

<p>The town was transformed. A soft, white blanket covered everything, muffling the usual sounds and creating a peaceful, almost magical atmosphere. We couldn’t resist. We bundled up in our warmest clothes, grabbed our cameras, and ventured out to capture the beauty of the moment.</p>

<p>The ancient cobblestone streets were quiet, save for the crunch of our boots on the fresh snow. We found the snow clinging to the iconic rooftops, dusting the cobblestone lanes, and highlighting the grandeur of the cathedral. Each scene was a perfect winter postcard, a beautiful contrast to the town’s usual charm.</p>

<p>It was a simple pleasure, but one we won’t soon forget. May today bring a fresh dusting of delight, whatever the weather brings.</p>

Our itinerary included the city of Nîmes, the iconic Pont du Gard, and the charming town of Arles.</p>

<p>While the weather was a bit unpredictable, we enjoyed a delightful picnic in a local vineyard, savoring the regional wines and soaking up the autumnal atmosphere. Nîmes didn’t quite live up to our expectations, but the other destinations were truly captivating. The Pont du Gard, an awe-inspiring Roman aqueduct, remains an engineering masterpiece. We marveled at its grandeur and enjoyed a leisurely stroll along the river.</p>

<p>Arles, with its rich history and artistic heritage, stole our hearts. We explored the Roman ruins, strolled along the Rhône River, and soaked up the unique atmosphere of the town. This trip was a feast for the senses, despite the occasional rain showers. We savored delicious local cuisine, enjoyed the fragrance of autumnal blooms, and captured the warm, soft light of the fading sun in our photographs.</p>
