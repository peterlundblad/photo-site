<p>Laughter echoed through the damp forest as we followed the gurgling creek, the bright light filtering through the leaves in soft elegance. The falls themselves were a masterpiece – cascading water veiling a moss-covered rock face, its roar filling the air with raw power.</p>

<p>As the day continued, we reluctantly left, but the magic remained in our thoughts. The scent of damp earth, the echo of laughter, the cool spray of the falls – all crowned by the simple joy of connection and nature’s wonder, even on a rainy day.</p>

A hush o’er nature starts to sprawl,
The sun’s warm kiss begins to wane,
And shadows dance upon the lane.</p>

<p>The air grows crisp, the colors fade,
As evening’s grace takes center stage,
A symphony of hues unite,
In dusky robes of fading light.</p>

<p>The birds their final songs do sing,
As day takes flight on silent wing,
Stars emerge, like diamonds rare,
In heavens’ tapestry so fair.</p>

<p>Oh, dusk, thy tender touch doth bring,
A tranquil hush on feathered wing,
A moment’s pause, a sigh of ease,
As day and night embrace with ease.</p>

<p>So let us cherish this sweet hour,
When nature dons her twilight dower,
In dusk’s embrace, we find our rest,
As day retires to the west.</p>

it beckons there to sink and hide.<br />
What once was bold and brave,<br />
now only sees the calling grave.<br />
The sky sees and offers it an ear,<br />
hoping to help his friend so dear.<br />
“I know your pain inside,<br />
let’s talk and so confide.”<br />
The ocean pours its deep reveal,<br />
but finds no hope to heal.<br />
“I cannot help but feel this misery,<br />
great gales I brought to history.<br />
All the boats I’ve dashed to rocks<br />
and sunk the countless shipping docks.<br />
“But, no!” the clouds reply.<br />
“I’ve felt your pain and cry!<br />
With each passing wind and storm,<br />
a sadness, great deform.<br />
Forced the trees to sway and bend,<br />
Even carried homes upon the wind.<br />
Broken panes and steep calamity,<br />
It’s caused me pure insanity.<br />
But then, observe the sunset stage,<br />
and feel the cooling winds of change.<br />
I’ve carried drops across the land,<br />
and washed upon the arid sand.<br />
From that harvest bounty,<br />
crops for all, across the county.<br />
So my ocean friend,<br />
may this story make amend.<br />
I hold you in great esteem,<br />
I see your fish and all that teem.<br />
Listen to the gulls above,<br />
see the dolphins dance with love.<br />
Despite the wrecks and strife,<br />
Your waters are a place of life.”<br />
And so the ocean felt the changing current,<br />
perhaps it was his lesson learnt.<br />
And with this hopeful, swelling glee<br />
It replied, “you’re just like me.”<br /></p>
