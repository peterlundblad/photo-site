In mid-March, we woke up to a sight that felt like a dream â€“ snow! For two Californians, accustomed to sunshine and mild winters, it was a delightful surprise. A proper snow day, right here in the medieval town of Semur-en-Auxois, France!

The town was transformed. A soft, white blanket covered everything, muffling the usual sounds and creating a peaceful, almost magical atmosphere. We couldn't resist. We bundled up in our warmest clothes, grabbed our cameras, and ventured out to capture the beauty of the moment.

The ancient cobblestone streets were quiet, save for the crunch of our boots on the fresh snow. We found the snow clinging to the iconic rooftops, dusting the cobblestone lanes, and highlighting the grandeur of the cathedral. Each scene was a perfect winter postcard, a beautiful contrast to the town's usual charm.

It was a simple pleasure, but one we won't soon forget. May today bring a fresh dusting of delight, whatever the weather brings.
