In early winter, we spent a few magical days in Switzerland, where we were greeted by a blanket of fresh snow. Our destination was Swiss L’Abri, a retreat space we’ve wanted to visit for a long time. It was the perfect setting to rest, reflect, and gather inspiration for our own retreat space, [The Poetry Factory](https://poetryfactory.xyz/). The serene landscapes, warm hospitality, and meaningful conversations made it an unforgettable experience.
