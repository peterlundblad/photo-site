Have you ever been to San Francisco City Hall? It is sooooo cool. Talk about powerful architecture. There is so much detail here; so many interesting things to look at. I particularly love the elaborate but elegant details that make up the building. You literally can stare at the ceiling for 30 mins. No wonder so many people come here to get married or elope. I even met some people that flew in from Arizona, just to get married there.Â 

You have take a visit!
