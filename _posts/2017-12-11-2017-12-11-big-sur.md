The ocean calls in defeated sigh,<br>
it beckons there to sink and hide.<br>
What once was bold and brave,<br>
now only sees the calling grave.<br>
The sky sees and offers it an ear,<br>
hoping to help his friend so dear.<br>
“I know your pain inside,<br>
let’s talk and so confide.”<br>
The ocean pours its deep reveal,<br>
but finds no hope to heal.<br>
“I cannot help but feel this misery,<br>
great gales I brought to history.<br>
All the boats I’ve dashed to rocks<br>
and sunk the countless shipping docks.<br>
“But, no!” the clouds reply.<br>
“I’ve felt your pain and cry!<br>
With each passing wind and storm,<br>
a sadness, great deform.<br>
Forced the trees to sway and bend,<br>
Even carried homes upon the wind.<br>
Broken panes and steep calamity,<br>
It’s caused me pure insanity.<br>
But then, observe the sunset stage,<br>
and feel the cooling winds of change.<br>
I’ve carried drops across the land,<br>
and washed upon the arid sand.<br>
From that harvest bounty,<br>
crops for all, across the county.<br>
So my ocean friend,<br>
may this story make amend.<br>
I hold you in great esteem,<br>
I see your fish and all that teem.<br>
Listen to the gulls above,<br>
see the dolphins dance with love.<br>
Despite the wrecks and strife,<br>
Your waters are a place of life.”<br>
And so the ocean felt the changing current,<br>
perhaps it was his lesson learnt.<br>
And with this hopeful, swelling glee<br>
It replied, “you’re just like me.”<br>
