I'm pretty excited to share these photos with ya! As you may know I've been playing around with film recently and just got some images back from the developer (for those film folks out there, this was Portra 400 and developed at 
[Richard Photo Lab](http://www.richardphotolab.com){:target="_blank"}). 

Oh ya! I went up the coast into Mendocino County. I stopped along the way to visit places like 
[Philo Apple Farm](http://www.philoapplefarm.com/index.php){:target="_blank"}  and 
[Anderson Valley Brewing Company](https://avbc.com){:target="_blank"}. Philo Apple Farm is so cool. It's pretty rustic and old world feeling. They've got a small farm stand where I bought the best peach I had this summer. They even let you walk around the orchards and through their amazing garden. 

Overall, it was a lot of fun and I can't wait to do it again.
