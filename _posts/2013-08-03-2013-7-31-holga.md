I've got some more Holga shots for ya! I just stopped by the film shop today and immediately got to scanning. Here are my favorites. This roll was shot on a road trip to San Diego and a bit in San Francisco. We stopped in LA to visit 
[Handsome Coffee Roasters](http://www.handsomecoffee.com). If you are ever in the area, you have to stop by for a cappuccino.Â
