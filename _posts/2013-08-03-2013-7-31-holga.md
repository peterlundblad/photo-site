I've got some fresh film scans for you! I just swung by the film lab and couldn't wait to get these scanned. This roll was captured on a recent road trip down the California coast, taking me from San Francisco to San Diego.

The Holga, a low-cost plastic film camera, is renowned for its unpredictable results. With its signature light leaks, dreamy bokeh, and unreliable focus, the Holga encourages a playful and experimental approach to photography.

The Holga added a unique layer to the everyday scenes I encountered. One of my favorite images is a happy accident â€“ a long exposure that bled into a portrait, creating an unexpected and surreal effect.

This road trip was a reminder to embrace the unexpected and find beauty in the imperfections, both in the world around me and in the creative process itself.
