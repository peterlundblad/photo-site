I had the emmense privilege of helping my friend Char Brodersen with his recent record project. For this project, we went down to Coasta Mesa to record a few songs for a hymn album that he has been wanting to make for a while. This video is a glimpse into the making of one of those hymns. The aim of this project was to take a few ancient hymns and reinterpret them in an engaging and dynamic manner. A special thanks to Neil Godding for producing this album. Enjoy the following stills and watch the video already!
