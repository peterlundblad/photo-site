In late November, we traveled to Paris, where the autumn foliage in the surrounding countryside was ablaze with vibrant oranges and yellows. While in the city, we were fortunate to experience Paris Photo, an inspiring exhibition showcasing contemporary photography. The sheer breadth and creativity on display left us truly amazed.

A particular highlight was Hope's exciting collaboration with the talented artist duo, [Kyano](https://www.kyano-studio.com). We were honored to attend the opening of their new exhibition, where Hope had the privilege of reading some of her poetry.

Of course, we also spent time exploring the iconic streets of Paris, soaking up the city's undeniable charm and artistic energy.
