I've been getting more excited about doing film photography lately. Why? I love the look and aesthetic that is inherit with film. There is something very appealing about the colors and the grain that come hand in hand with the craft. Sure it is expensive and time consuming to buy film, develop it, and scan it but it's worth it. 

I'm almost done reading a great book called 
[Film is Not Dead](http://www.amazon.com/books/dp/0321812808) by 
[Jonathan Canlas](http://www.jonathancanlasphotography.com). It's both an overview of working with film but also an appeal to starting shooting with film. I highly recommend it if you are only slightly interested in film.

Lastly, I just pick up a Holga camera! I'll leave you with the following images I shot on my first roll with the "toy camera." 

Enjoy.
