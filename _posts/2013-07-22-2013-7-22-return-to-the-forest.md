I think I have a new favorite spot in San Francisco. 

It's called [Mt. Davidson](http://www.mtdavidson.org), and it couldn't be more of a departure from the bustling nature of city life. Every time I go there, I feel a strange sensation because this park does not at all feel like it's in the middle of the city.  It's extremely dense with vegetation and on foggy days almost as an other worldly feeling.

You have to visit it for yourself.
