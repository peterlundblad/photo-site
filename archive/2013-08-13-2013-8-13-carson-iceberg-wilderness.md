I recently had the privilege of spending a few days in the 
[Carson Iceberg Wilderness](http://www.fs.usda.gov/recarea/stanislaus/recarea/?recid=15109) with my dad and a buddy. It was great to get away and enjoy the wilderness. We found this great little meadow with a pond, old rundown cabins, and a bunch of cattle with bells. We totally felt like we were in the Alps! 

Enjoy these iPhone images.
