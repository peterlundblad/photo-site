Guess what!?

I have another video for ya... but this time it's one of mine. I shot this piece a while back with Jason Perry Stevens from the SF band, Before the Brave. I was aiming for a rough, unpolished video that felt raw and genuine. I took a lot of inspiration from the Take Away Shows that 
[La Blogothèque](http://en.blogotheque.net/) is known for. 

Special thanks to Jason for working with me. He is a pleasure to be around and is so talented. 

Without further ado... here it is!
