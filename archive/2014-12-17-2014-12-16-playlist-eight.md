Playlist 8 is here and ready to be enjoyed! One of my favorite tracks include CPR / Claws  Pt. 2 by Typhoon, which has this great, driving rhythm along side some warm and clean guitar riffs.  I'm also a big fan of Ooh La La by Faces. This track has this carefree sound that reminds me of summer for some reason (I know it's winter). It also has an awesome solo in the the middle from an out of tune piano. Maybe one day I'll be able to play like that!

Enjoy!
