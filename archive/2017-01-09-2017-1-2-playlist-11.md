I love collecting music via playlists. There's something so enjoyable about pairing different tracks together, forming something bigger and (hopefully) better. Playlists also serve as mini time capsules, showing my progression of taste through time (aka it's fun to look back in a year or two and see forgotten tracks or remember what I was doing while I found a particular song). 

Enjoy!

PS, these playlist features more 
[dream pop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dream_pop) tracks like "Evil Coast" and "Ace of Cups." Be sure to check out Chis Cohen's track "Torrey Pine."
