Anyone else noticing how film photography is a thing again? (maybe it's just me looking a few other photographers, but then again maybe not)

Film is pretty intimidating at first, but with a few tips and some practice, great results are obtainable.

Here's what I've been learning and practicing lately:

*Intentionally 
overexpose your color film

WHAT? Overexpose your film on purpose? That's correct. Color film is surprisingly forgivable when overexposed. Your colors will actually be more vibrant, and grain is often less noticeable. Underexposing on the other hand leads to grainy, dull images. Even with simple point and shoot cameras one can achieve great images. The trick is to set your ISO lower than the box speed of the film. If I'm shooting ISO 400 film then I set the camera to 200 or even 100.
