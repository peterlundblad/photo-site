Playlist 10 is officially here and it's an ode to my ongoing enthusiasm for folk music. This collection features both new and old, from Noah Gundersen to Lanterns on the Lake. A notable track is the rare "He Was a Friend of Mine"  from Bob Dylan's 
[The Bootleg Series](https://open.spotify.com/album/0ELQw29ii1k2eHnAYgt5kw). Enjoy!
