This next mix is awesome. Local Natives, Washed Out, Beach House, and more. This music is makes me want go make art or something. I've been trying to classify this sort of music for a while and I can never quite describe it any better than something unhelpful like indie rock. Regardless think nostalgic synths, colorful textures, and dreamy soundscapes all without being that tacky mediation-sounding music that is sold at car washes.
