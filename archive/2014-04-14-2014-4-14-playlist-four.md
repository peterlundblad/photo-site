It's music monday again! I don't know about you, but I love folk music. I love the mood, the tones, the simplicity that this genre offers.Â 

This playlist features some flat out amazing harmonies from bands like The Staves and Mountain Man. If you haven't heard of them before you are in for a treat.

Hope you enjoy these songs as much as I have.
