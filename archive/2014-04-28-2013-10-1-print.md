Ever wonder why images in images in newspapers always look like a bunch of tiny dots? I recently took a class on operating offset printing presses and I thought I'd show you what I got to work on.

Notice the dots that make up the image. These are called halftones and allow images to be printed affordably and quickly. These dots are similar to pixels on the computer and help create the various shades or tones in a given image.

The dots that make this image of the donkey are black... that's right no grey or white inks were used at all! The "shades of grey" are created by varying the size of the black dots;  our eyes end up blending them together to make the shades of grey that you see. 

That might be wayyyy to nerdy for some of you but I think it's great :)
