I hope you love jazz because I've got a bunch of music to share with you. I'm really not good with classifying music but I think some of this jazz considered to be bebop (I could be totally wrong). Anyway, I love the mood that all of these tracks have–it's a sort of happy, mellow, and nostalgic feeling I think.

Enjoy!
