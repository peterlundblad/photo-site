---finally got a roll of film developed recently and i love it! it’s the first roll of film i’ve shot in about a year and i’m excited to do more. why? shooting film forces me to slow down and concentrate on taking solid exposures. plus, i love grain.

i shot the majority of this roll with my buddy 
[jon](https://twitter.com/#!/faberlicious) which also made it a lot of fun. it’s always great to shoot with friends versus shooting alone.

that’s all from me and except more film to come!
