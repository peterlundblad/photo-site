Got another video for you. This time is from a favorite band of mine, Fleet Foxes. I love that the footage in this is shot on with real film, not digital-trying-to-look-like-film. How can I tell? Look how unsharp the images are. Look at how saturated the colors are (without looking overdone). The result is footage that has an authentic look and feel; it's got character. It literally looks like it could be mistaken for something shot decades ago. Anyway, enough geeking out about the look of it... just watch it!
