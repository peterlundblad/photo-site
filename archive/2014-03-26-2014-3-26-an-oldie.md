Got some super grainy 35mm images for you today. I took these last year on a ski trip with my dad in Lake Tahoe. Â The views here are on the Nevada side of the mountain and are overlooking Carson City. In my opinion, these are some of the best scenes on the West Coast.

These images were shot on black and white film (not sure if it was Tmax or an off brand). Anyway, don't you just love that grain?!
